/* Best.java */

/**
 *  A public class for holding the fields of a Best move. This class is a container for data, not an  
 *  ADT;  hence all the fields are public.
 * The move field stores a move.
 * The score field stores the score assigned to such a move.
  * This allows minimax to return a score and a move.
